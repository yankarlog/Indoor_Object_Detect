# Exploration for Indoor Object Detection

## Introduction

Hello my name is Yankarlo. I been employed by Greentechpainting to work on developing a Indoor Object detection program. This is the proof of concept.

## Project Overview

The painting trade is the last one to enter the construction process as their job involves painting the finished product of trades like carpentry. This creates a vulnerability to the painting cashflow as they are the last to be paid. By automatizing the painting process painting companies will lower their expenses. I present an exploration of using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as a means to later create an AI capable of making an accurate cost estimate. This automatization will reduce manpower needed in smaller companies thereby alleviating some of the workload. This exploration achieved a total accuracy of 69% with live object detection.
